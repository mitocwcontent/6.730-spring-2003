  caption: '**Top:** schematic of a 2-D crystal showing a regular lattice of atomic
    oribitals. **Bottom:** the calculated electronic bandstructure as a function of
    the electron''s crystal momentum (k). The core skills taught in this class will
    be to think of electron transport in k-space and to calculate the bandstructure
    as shown here. (Image by Rajeev Ram.)'
